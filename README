This is my little proposal for how I would like error handling in C to be implemented. I've been fiddling with Linux syscalls the past few days and have noticed that they have pretty inconvenient error handling strategies. This repo will not, of course, change syscall interfaces, but will, hopefully, give an idea to future programmers about how error handling can be pretty nicely implemented in C. *More* nicely than it is now, that is: the language is still pretty limited and will not allow to do things most conveniently. This repo is more of a crutch, but a consistent one, I think.
